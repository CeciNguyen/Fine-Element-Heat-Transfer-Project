## What is in the Repository?
In this repository, you will find three different files.
## Weak Form
### Project Prompt Part 1) Derive the weak form of this equation by-hand on paper and submit with your code.
Before we dive into what the file entails, let's discuss what the weak form is.
#### What is the Weak Form?
The weak form is a mathematical reformulation of a partial differential equation (PDE) that is more amenable to numerical approximation, particularly in the context of finite element methods. It is derived by multiplying the PDE by a test function and integrating it over the problem domain.
Once the weak form is derived, numerical methods like finite element methods can be applied to approximate the solution by discretizing the domain and replacing the continuous functions with finite-dimensional approximations. The weak form provides a more flexible and general framework for numerical simulations, allowing for easy adaptation to different geometries, boundary conditions, and types of problems.
#### What is in the file?
The pdf file contains the weak form of the heat transfer equation given by the project prompt.
## Forward Euler Method
### Project Prompt Part 2) Solve first by using a forward Euler time derivative discretization with a time-step of Œîùë° = 1/551. Plot the results at the final time. Increase the time-step until you find the instability. What dt does this occur at? How does the solution change as N decreases?
### Results
## Backward Euler Method
### Project Prompt Part 3) Part Solve the same problem with the same time-steps using an implicit backward Euler. What happens as the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size? Explain why.
When the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size, the backward Euler method remains stable, and the numerical solution does not exhibit the instability issues observed with the forward Euler method.

The backward Euler method is an implicit time-stepping method, which means it involves solving a linear system of equations at each time step. In the case of this heat transfer problem, the linear system involves the mass matrix (M) and the stiffness matrix (K). The implicit nature of backward Euler allows it to handle larger time-step sizes compared to explicit methods like forward Euler.

When the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size, the backward Euler method remains unconditionally stable. This stability is a desirable property because it allows for larger time-step sizes, potentially reducing the computational cost of the simulation.

In summary, backward Euler is more robust in handling larger time-step sizes, and it remains stable even when the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size.
