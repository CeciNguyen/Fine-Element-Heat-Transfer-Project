## What is in the Repository?
## Weak Form
Derive the weak form of this equation by-hand on paper and submit with your code.
## Forward Euler Method
Solve first by using a forward Euler time derivative discretization with a time-step of Œîùë° = 1/551. Plot the results at the final time. Increase the time-step until you find the instability. What dt does this occur at? How does the solution change as N decreases?
## Backward Euler Method
Solve the same problem with the same time-steps using an implicit backward Euler. What happens as the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size? Explain why.
## What are the differences between the two methods?
## What did I learn from this?
