## Weak Form

### Project Prompt Part 1) Derive the weak form of this equation by-hand on paper and submit with your code.
Before we dive into what the file entails, let's discuss what the weak form is.

#### What is the Weak Form?
The weak form is a mathematical reformulation of a partial differential equation (PDE) that is more amenable to numerical approximation, particularly in the context of finite element methods. It is derived by multiplying the PDE by a test function and integrating it over the problem domain.
Once the weak form is derived, numerical methods like finite element methods can be applied to approximate the solution by discretizing the domain and replacing the continuous functions with finite-dimensional approximations. The weak form provides a more flexible and general framework for numerical simulations, allowing for easy adaptation to different geometries, boundary conditions, and types of problems.

#### What is in the file?
The pdf file contains the weak form of the heat transfer equation given by the project prompt. In this process, I define the elemental matrices for mass and stiffness (and possibly other) terms and integrate over each element using numerical quadrature to obtain the elemental contributions to the global matrices. 


## Forward Euler Method

### Project Prompt Part 2) Solve first by using a forward Euler time derivative discretization with a time-step of Œîùë° = 1/551. Plot the results at the final time. Increase the time-step until you find the instability. What dt does this occur at? How does the solution change as N decreases?
Before we get into the questions, let's discuss the code!
This Python script solves a one-dimensional heat transfer problem using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with the Forward Euler time integration scheme. The problem is defined on a domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

#### Key Features:
1. Finite Element Method:
- Discretizes the domain into elements and solves the heat transfer problem numerically.
2. Gaussian Quadrature:

3. Time Integration:

Matplotlib
SciPy

### Results
<p> So, what happens when the time step increases? As seen in the given plots, the peaks of each parabolic graph increase but, why? The increasing peak in the plots might be related to numerical instability. The explicit Forward Euler method I used for time integration is conditionally stable, meaning there is a maximum time step beyond which the solution becomes unstable. With my code, I found that the maximum allowable dt before instability occurs is 0.1161524500907441. </p>

<p>How does the solution change as N decreases? The graph becomes less defined and the peak becomes lower. Why? As the number of nodes decreases and the spatial grid becomes coarser, the numerical solution may lose accuracy, exhibit a smoother profile, and potentially result in a lower peak value. It's essential to strike a balance between computational efficiency (which benefits from coarser grids) and the need for accurate representation of the solution features (which benefits from finer grids). Experimenting with different spatial resolutions and assessing the impact on the solution can help in understanding the trade-offs involved. </p>

## Backward Euler Method

Before we get into the questions, let's discuss the code!

### Results
What happens as the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size? When the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size, the backward Euler method remains stable, and the numerical solution does not exhibit the instability issues observed with the forward Euler method. The backward Euler method is an implicit time-stepping method, which means it involves solving a linear system of equations at each time step. In the case of this heat transfer problem, the linear system involves the mass matrix (M) and the stiffness matrix (K). The implicit nature of backward Euler allows it to handle larger time-step sizes compared to explicit methods like forward Euler. When the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size, the backward Euler method remains unconditionally stable. This stability is a desirable property because it allows for larger time-step sizes, potentially reducing the computational cost of the simulation. In summary, backward Euler is more robust in handling larger time-step sizes, and it remains stable even when the time-step is equal to or greater than the spatial step size.


## What are the differences between the two methods?

### Viewing the different conditions
With the given project prompt, the Forward Euler Method becomes unstable as the time steps increase. The stability of the Forward Euler Method is subject to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is a necessary condition for stability in numerical methods, especially for solving partial differential equations like the heat equation. The time step must be small enough compared to the spatial grid size and the diffusivity to ensure stability. If the time step exceeds this limit, the forward Euler method becomes numerically unstable, leading to unphysical oscillations and growing solution amplitudes. As you increase the time step (Œît), you might be violating the CFL condition, making the numerical solution unstable. The instability becomes more pronounced as the time step increases, and you observe unphysical behavior in the solution.

With the plots provided by the Backward Euler Method, the plots become more stable as the time steps increase! While the Backward Euler Method is unconditionally stable, its accuracy may depend on the time step size. Smaller time steps usually result in more accurate numerical solutions. However, if the time step becomes extremely small, numerical precision issues may arise, causing instability.

### Stable Conditions
If you look into the different plots from both methods, you will find that the Forward Euler Method and the Backward Euler Method have very similar parabolic shapes when given the same stable conditions. However, if you look at the y-axis for both plots you can find that the peak is drastically different. Why is that?

The difference in peak values between the forward Euler and backward Euler methods is likely due to the stability characteristics and numerical dissipation introduced by each method.

#### Numerical Dissipation: 
The forward Euler method is known for introducing numerical dissipation, which tends to smooth out high-frequency components in the solution. This numerical dissipation can be beneficial for stabilizing the solution, especially when the time step is relatively large. However, it can also lead to a damping effect, reducing the amplitude of oscillations in the solution.

#### Stability Characteristics: 
The forward Euler method is conditionally stable, meaning there are restrictions on the time step for stability. If the time step exceeds certain limits (related to the CFL condition), the solution becomes unstable. On the other hand, the backward Euler method is unconditionally stable for linear problems, allowing for larger time steps without stability concerns.

#### Accuracy and Truncation Errors: 
The backward Euler method generally provides more accurate results than the forward Euler method for the same time step. The backward Euler method is an implicit scheme, which means it involves solving a linear system at each time step. This implicit treatment can lead to better accuracy, especially for stiff problems.

#### Analytical Solution Discrepancy: 
It's important to note that the analytical solution serves as a reference, and discrepancies between numerical and analytical solutions may arise due to various factors, including numerical approximations, time step size, and the nature of the problem.

In summary, while the backward Euler method may yield a closer match to the analytical solution in terms of peak values, the forward Euler method introduces more numerical dissipation, potentially leading to a smoother and less oscillatory solution. The choice between these methods often involves a trade-off between stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimenting with different time step sizes and numerical methods can help find a balance that meets the requirements of your specific problem.
